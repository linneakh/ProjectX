# Soil Pyruvate Experiment 
## Effect of drought on microbial metabolic activity and VOC production, assessed using multi-omics and stable isotope probing in the tropical rainforest at Biosphere 2

### **Description of Project** <br>
Due to climate change, the frequency and duration of droughts in
tropical rain forests (TRFs) are expected to increase, having a
significant impact on soil carbon dynamics . The role of microbes as
drivers of changing carbon flow, particularly in relation to metabolic
pathways and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), remains largely
unknown.  

#### **Biosphere 2 drought experiment**<br>
To examine how microbial activity, particularly in relation to carbon allocation, shifts
during drought, we utilized the controlable conditions of the glass and steelenclosed
TRF at Biosphere 2 (Fig 1). Here we created a 66-day drought in order to
study carbon cycling by plants and microbes before, during, and after drought (Water,
Atmosphere, and Life Dynamics [WALD]) . As part of this larger study, we perfomed
multi-omics and traced carbon allocation by soil microbes using position-specific (C1 or
C2) C-pyruvate labeling before and during drought. Our results will inform key
processes in tropical soil carbon cycling. For more detailed description of project, see wiki page link below<br>

A Little history... of what was done:

1. Created a _new Repositoy_ in Gihub or Clone One. I named this Repository: ProjectX
2. Cloned the Remote Github Repository into a local repository on my computer using Github Desktop (Decide what will be your local repository directory).
3. On the local repository create some planned directory structure, using the file manager or other:
   - Datasets
   - Docs
   - Images
   - Notebooks
   - Reports
   - Software
   - Publications
4.These files and directory structure will be in the \<code\> section of your Github repository.
5. You can start moving files if you already have them classified.
6. You can edit your Readme.md file using Atom Editor in your computer. Remember CTRL+SHIFT+M open the Markup Language Viewer.
7. When you have made important changes **Commit** (update files from local to remote repository) using Github Desktop.
8. After finishig the commit, you can check the Github remote repository to see published resources.
