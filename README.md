A Little history... of what was done:

1. Created a _new Repositoy_ in Gihub or Clone One. I named this Repository: ProjectX
2. Cloned the Remote Github Repository into a local repository on my computer using Github Desktop (Decide what will be your local repository directory).
3. On the local repository create some planned directory structure, using the file manager or other:
   - Datasets
   - Docs
   - Images
   - Notebooks
   - Reports
   - Software
   - Publications
4.These files and directory structure will be in the \<code\> section of your Github repository.
5. You can start moving files if you already have them classified.
6. You can edit your Readme.md file using Atom Editor in your computer. Remember CTRL+SHIFT+M open the Markup Language Viewer.
7. When you have made important changes **Commit** (update files from local to remote repository) using Github Desktop.
8. After finishig the commit, you can check the Github remote repository to see published resources.
